        	'post'=>'<p>In the simplest of terms, a <strong>neural network</strong> is a computer system modelled on the human nervous system.</p>
<p>It is widely used in machine learning technology. R is an open source programming language, which is mostly used by statisticians and data miners. It greatly supports machine learning, for which it has many packages. The neural network is the most widely used machine learning technology available today. Its algorithm mimics the functioning of the human brain to train a computational network to identify the inherent patterns of the data under investigation. There are several variations of this computational network to process data, but the most common is the feedforward-backpropagation configuration. Many tools are available for its implementation, but most of them are expensive and proprietary. There are at least 30 different packages of open source neural network software available, and of them, R, with its rich neural network packages, is much ahead.</p>',

        	'post'=>'<p>AI, deep learning and machine learning are often mistaken for each other. Take a look at how they differ in this interesting article.<br /><br />From being dismissed as science fiction to becoming an integral part of multiple, wildly popular movie series, especially the one starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, artificial intelligence has been a part of our life for longer than we realise. The idea of machines that can think has widely been attributed to a British mathematician and WWII code-breaker, Alan Turing. In fact, the Turing Test, often used for benchmarking the &lsquo;intelligence&rsquo; in artificial intelligence, is an interesting process in which AI has to convince a human, through a conversation, that it is not a robot. There have been a number of other tests developed to verify how evolved AI is, including Goertzel&rsquo;s Coffee Test and Nilsson&rsquo;s Employment Test that compare a robot&rsquo;s performance in different human tasks.</p>',

        	'post'=>'<p>Ubuntu Core is a minimalistic version of Ubuntu. It is lightweight and is designed for use with embedded systems and IoT devices. Snaps are universal Linux packages, which are faster to install, easier to create, and safe to run and work on multiple distributions.<br /><br />The biggest challenge in delivering Linux applications is dependency resolution. As distributions update underlying libraries frequently, it is not always possible to offer application binaries as offline archives. One can&rsquo;t think of downgrading an application if underlying packages are upgraded, which are in turn required by some more applications. Also, it&rsquo;s not possible to keep multiple versions of the same library in view of different applications. Ubuntu Core has a solution for all this complexity, whereby a single device can host multiple isolated applications with their own dependencies.</p>',
