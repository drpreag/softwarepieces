                SoftwarePieces was started as my personal project and I created it to achieve a few goals. 
                <br><br>
                First was to bring all relevant open source world news and informations at single place, so people who think similar then I do can have easy way to get and read them.
                <br>
                Also I always wanted to have kind of a blog, where my friends and myself can share our sight on open source stuff.
                <br><br> 
                But, during a time project has been growing up, needed some expertises that I don't have, and it was impossible to me to continye all by myself. So I invited a few friend to join me and do here what they are best in. Here are listed a contributions:
                <br><br>
                ... add text here ...
                <br><br>
                If you are open source fan I hope that you will enjoy this app. Also, if you find yourself as expert in any open source area and you don't have your personal blog yet, I urge you to join a team and start writing for SoftwarePieces.<br><br>
                Yours, drPreAG.
